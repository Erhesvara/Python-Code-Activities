# Review Exercise
# 1. For each of the following conditional expressions, guess whether they evaluate to True or False.
#   then type them into the interactive window to check your answers:
# 2. For each of the following expressions, fill in the blank (indicated by_) with an appropriate Boolean comparator
#   so that the expression evaluates to True:
#   3 _ 4
#   10 _ 5
#   "jack" _ "jill"
#   42 _ "42"

# 1.)
true = 1 <= 1
false = 1 != 1
true_2 = 1 != 2
true_3 = "good" != "bad"
true_4 = "good" != "Good"
false_2 = 123 == "123"

# 2.)
true_5 = 3 < 4
true_6 = 10 > 5
true_7 = "jack" < "jill"
true_8 = 42 != "42"
